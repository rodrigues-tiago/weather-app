# About this Project

This project is a simple Weather App that gives information about weekly forecasts and other useful weather information from portuguese district capitals and islands. Forecast data is automatically obtained and updated twice a day using an API (https://api.ipma.pt/) from IPMA (Portuguese Institute of the Sea and Atmosphere).
